USA TODAY\\nSierra Nevada Brewing Co. in Chico, California, in making Resilience Butte County Proud IPA, the proceeds of which will support Camp Fire relief efforts. (Photo: Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.)\\nThe deadliest fire in California history has set into motion the largest charitable collaboration ever among the nation\\'s breweries, as more than 1,200 have signed on to brew a beer to raise funds for those affected by the Camp Fire in Northern California.\\nSierra Nevada Brewing Co., which is located in Chico, California, part of Butte County but west of the areas hardest hit by the fire, fed first responders and displaced residents during the fire and handed out clothing, too.\\nBut Ken Grossman, who founded the brewery in 1980, wanted to do more. He decided to brew a special beer, Resilience Butte County Proud IPA, and donate all the proceeds to the Sierra Nevada Camp Fire Relief Fund, which it seeded with a $100,000 donation.\\nThen, Grossman asked other breweries across the U.S. to join in. \"We are working with malt, hop and yeast suppliers to provide raw ingredient donations to all participating breweries and are asking those breweries to donate 100 percent of their sales to the fund, as well,\" he said in the letter, a copy of which is posted online.\\n\"We know that the rebuilding process will take time, but we\\'re in this for the long haul,\" Grossman said. \"Our hope is to get Resilience IPA in taprooms all over the country to create a solid start for our community\\'s future.\"\\nMore: Paradise fire survivor: \\'This was my home before, and I want it to be again\\'\\nMore: Colossal California wildfire finally contained; grim search for bodies continues\\nCollaboration is common among independent brewers, and so is the brewing of charity beers. But the response to Sierra Nevada\\'s Camp Fire initiative has been historic. \"I\\'m quite sure that it\\'s both the largest-ever collaboration and the biggest industry charity ever,\" said Garrett Oliver, brewmaster at Brooklyn Brewery.\\nSo far, more than 1,000 breweries have pledged to make their own batches of Resilience Butte County Proud IPA. \"This is a great idea spearheaded by a great indie craft brewing pioneer supporting a great cause,\" said Sam Calagione, co-founder of Dogfish Head Craft Brewery in Milton, Delaware, which brewed its batch of Resilience IPA and plans to serve it in late December.\\n\"Our thoughts are with all of the brave folks who have helped navigate this challenging moment in Northern California and all of the families who have lost love ones,\" Calagione said. \"The craft brewing community has always been altruistic and mutually supportive, and giving back to our communities is one of the things we collectively do best.\"\\nDogfish Head Craft Brewery in Milton, Delaware, is one of about 1,000 breweries joining Sierra Nevada Brewing Co. in making Resilience Butte County IPA, the proceeds of which will support Camp Fire relief efforts. (Photo: Dogfish Head Craft Brewery)\\nAnother of the participating breweries, Fort Collins, Colorado-headquartered New Belgium Brewing, recalls the hardship caused by the nearby 2012 High Park fire. The brewery\\'s paperboard manufacturer, Graphic Packaging International, is located in Oroville, California, in Butte County.\\n\"Many of their co-workers have tragically lost their homes, yet they\\'re still coming to work every day. That is the definition of resilience, and we\\'re happy to support recovery efforts in any way that we can,\" New Belgium Brewing CEO Steve Fechheimer said. New Belgium brewed its batch Tuesday and plans to make it available at its Fort Collins and Asheville tasting rooms in about two weeks.\\n\"At New Belgium, we believe that business can be a force for good, and we think that ethos is shared throughout the craft beer community,\" Fechheimer said.\\nSierra Nevada Brewing Co. in Chico, California, in making Resilience Butte County Proud IPA, the proceeds of which will support Camp Fire relief efforts. (Photo: Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.)\\nSierra Nevada brewed its batch of more than 74,000 gallons on Tuesday and plans to release it Jan. 5, 2019. Sierra will can some of that beer and also make it available on draft. Other participating breweries will only sell Resilience IPA on draft, with most releases planned in late December and early January. Overall, the project should yield about 8.6 million pints of beer, the brewery estimates.\\nBreweries joining include small, midsize and regional breweries nationwide as well as Anheuser-Busch-owned Goose Island Beer Co. and Miller Coors-owned Blue Moon Brewing Co. For a list of the breweries participating, go to Sierra Nevada\\'s website. There\\'s also a Google Doc on the brewery site, now listing more than 1,200 breweries on board.\\nThere are now more than 1,000 breweries listed on the @SierraNevada\\nResilience Butte County Proud IPA page. Pretty awesome reminder of how the brewing community can come together.https://t.co/Z2hB12BSlq - Bart Watson (@BrewersStats) November 27, 2018\\n\"Even as the beer industry has grown so much since the early days and become increasingly competitive, it is so wonderful to see hundreds of breweries nationwide rallying behind one of the movement\\'s absolute most important pioneers,\" said Greg Engert, beer director for Neighborhood Restaurant Group in Alexandria, Virginia, which brewed a batch of the IPA at its Bluejacket brewery in Washington, D.C.\\nSierra Nevada\\'s Grossman had hopes of sharing the beer\\'s recipe with perhaps 500 breweries that would also make the beer and donate the proceeds. \"That was kind of his pie-in-the-sky goal; if we really work hard maybe we can hit 500 breweries, and we have doubled that number,\" brewery spokesperson Robin Gregory said. \"I know he wanted to raise at least seven figures, and it looks like, if our math is correct, it\\'s going to be a bit higher than that.\"\\nStone is proud to be participating in @SierraNevada\\'s #ResilienceIPA charity efforts. Sierra Nevada has come up with this new beer recipe and shared it with hundreds of other craft breweries to support those who now need our help after the fire. pic.twitter.com/31mZ1fjOw0 - Stone Brewing (@StoneBrewing) November 27, 2018\\nThe Camp Fire took the lives of at least 85, with another 249 listed as missing, and destroyed nearly 19,000 buildings. About 15 percent of Sierra Nevada Brewing Co. employees lost their homes in the fire, as did \"countless friends and family members as well,\" she said.\\nEven before the fire was officially extinguished, the brewery had set up the relief fund. \"Once the fire is out, we will distribute all donated money to partner organizations that are dedicated to rebuilding and supporting the communities that have been affected,\" Grossman said in a note on the brewery\\'s website, also signed by daughter Sierra and son Brian.\\nThe beer is a \"really classic\" West Coast-style India pale ale made with Centennial and Cascade hops, Gregory said. \"If it\\'s going to be raising money to rebuild our community, we felt like it should be a taste of home. We wanted to go with that classic danky west coast IPA ... (that is) fresh, piney, citrusy, hop-heavy, and nice and bright.\"\\nThank you @ButteSheriff@KoryHonea for helping us brew Resilience Butte County Proud IPA today.

He declined to agree to Democratic calls for him to recuse himself from any cases related to the Russia investigation. And he would not say where he would come down on abortion, amid expectations among conservatives he would like to overturn Roe v. Wade.\\nBut Democrats did not walk away from a deeply divisive hearing with nothing. Top lawmakers showed vigor in cross examining Kavanaugh and by portraying him as Trump\\'s man on the court and may have at least partly lived up to expectations of the party\\'s fired up base for a show of backbone ahead of the mid-term elections.\\nAfter emerging largely unscathed after the final round of questions from senators that stretched late into Thursday evening, Kavanaugh could take comfort in passing his biggest test. If Republicans stick together he is almost certain to be confirmed while minority Democrats face their own challenge in keeping the votes of red state senators with tough re-election races in their column.\\nBooker\\'s document fight\\nThursday\\'s hearing featured another bitter showdown between Democrats who are furious at the failure of the White House to hand over tens of thousands of key documents on time or at all, and at restrictions on the public release of material that was made available.\\nNew Jersey Democrat Cory Booker said he was ready to risk expulsion from the Senate for making public documents pertinent Kavanaugh\\'s time as a top White House aide to President George W. Bush, but the GOP mocked him for grandstanding ahead of a possible 2020 run -- saying it had already cleared the emails for release.\\nIn a striking political gambit, Booker, backed up by Democratic Sen. Mazie Hirono of Hawaii, released emails -- which had been designated as \"committee confidential\" -- that reference Kavanaugh\\'s position on racial profiling and thoughts on Roe v. Wade dating from his time as a White House official under Bush.\\nBooker, who as a potential 2020 presidential candidate had an incentive to make a splash in the hearing, said he took the action as an act of \"civil disobedience.\"\\n\"I understand the penalty comes with potential ousting from the Senate. ... I openly invite and accept the consequences of my team releasing that email right now,\" Booker said.\\n\"This is about the closest I\\'ll probably ever have in my life to an \\'I am Spartacus\\' moment,\" he added.\\nRepublican Sen John Cornyn warned Booker that releasing documents marked \"committee confidential\" would break Senate rules.\\n\"Running for president is not an excuse for violating the rules of the Senate,\" the Texas Republican said.\\nLater Thursday, Bill Burck, a lawyer who oversaw the process of providing Bush administration documents, undercut Booker\\'s grand gesture, saying that the material in question had been cleared on Wednesday night at the request of the senator\\'s staff.\\n\"We were surprised to learn about Senator Booker\\'s histrionics this morning because we had already told him he could use the documents publicly. In fact, we have said yes to every request made by the Senate Democrats to make documents public,\" Burck said in a statement.\\nThe office of Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican, also said that senators, including Booker, were notified \"before they spoke today\" that the restrictions on the documents had been waived.\\nBooker, however, insisted he was in the right, saying he read from the documents aloud in the hearing on Wednesday night long before they were cleared at around 4 a.m. Democrats have repeatedly complained that the White House is withholding tens of thousands of documents relevant to the nomination and wants many more that have been provided released to the public.\\nThe New Jersey senator also said he doubted Cornyn would follow through on his threats to enforce Senate discipline against him.\\n\"I think he\\'s like a lot of bullies are: a lot of talk, no action,\" Booker said.\\nNorth Carolina Republican Sen. Thom Tillis took exception to his Democratic colleague\\'s tactics.\\n\"Certainly in the six hours between the time that email hit your email box and the theatrics that happened in this chamber today you could have actually found out that you didn\\'t have to be Spartacus, you didn\\'t have to go interact with civil disobedience, you got what you wanted,\" Tillis said.\\nThe schoolyard taunts underlined how the hearing, ahead of what appears to be Kavanaugh\\'s likely confirmation, has become another battlefield in the vicious partisanship and complete lack of trust between the parties that is wracking Washington at a critical moment of the Trump era\\nBooker\\'s intervention followed a set of glowing reviews from liberals for another potential 2020 Democratic presidential candidate on the Judiciary Committee, Sen. Kamala Harris of California, who late Wednesday night appeared to discomfort Kavanaugh with a series of questions designed to find out with whom he had discussed special counsel Robert Mueller\\'s Russia investigation.\\nHarris returned to the question on Thursday evening, saying that she had been working on \"reliable information\" that Kavanaugh had a conversation about the probe with someone from Kasowitz Benson Torres, the law firm founded by Trump\\'s personal attorney Marc Kasowitz.\\nKavanaugh had sidestepped the question on Wednesday, so Harris asked him again and he replied \"the answer\\'s no.\"\\nEarlier, the firm said in a statement to CNN there had been no such discussions.\\nHarris did not disclose the \"reliable information\" on which she based her questions.\\nJUST WATCHED Senator challenges Kavanaugh on Mueller probe Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Senator challenges Kavanaugh on Mueller probe 02:55\\n2003 email shows Kavanaugh discussing Roe\\nIn another flashpoint development, a previously unreleased 2003 email from Kavanaugh, while he was an official in the Bush White House, shows him raising the point of whether Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court ruling that upheld the right to an abortion, was settled law of the land.\\nIn the internal White House email, obtained by CNN, Kavanaugh wrote: \"I am not sure that all legal scholars refer to Roe v. Wade as the settled law of the land at the Supreme Court level since Court can always overrule its precedent, and three current Justices on the Court would do so.\"\\n\"The point there is in the inferior court point,\" Kavanaugh wrote, responding to a draft op-ed that had been circulated for edits between lawmakers and White House staff.\\nThe draft, meant to be submitted under the name of \"high-profile, pro-choice\" women in support of a Bush judicial nominee, had said that \"it is widely understood accepted by legal scholars across the board that Roe v. Wade and its progeny are the settled law of the land.\"\\nDuring the confirmation hearing on Wednesday, Kavanaugh said: \"As a general proposition I understand the importance of the precedent set forth in Roe v. Wade.\"\\nTrump said during his campaign that he would appoint Supreme Court justices who would overturn Roe. In recent years, Supreme Court nominees have gotten through their confirmation hearings by refusing to say how they would rule on what they say is a hypothetical future case on the issue.\\nThe New York Times first reported the email.\\nThroughout the contentious hearing, now in its third day, Kavanaugh has tried to give political questions -- especially those related to Trump and his potential legal woes -- a wide berth.\\nOn Wednesday he insisted that \"no one is above the law\" but declined to say whether a sitting president must respond to a subpoena.\\nSenate Democrats have suggested that Kavanaugh could be biased in favor of the President and worry that his views on the primacy of executive power could help Trump evade legal scrutiny.\\nBooker warned that given Trump\\'s frequent attacks on the Justice Department there was a \"shadow over the independence of the judiciary\" and said it was understandable for some Americans to wonder whether a nominee picked by the President would owe loyalty to him or had been nominated to shield him from a criminal investigation.\\n\"My only loyalty is to the Constitution,\" Kavanaugh responded. \"I have made that clear, I am an independent judge.\" ', 'Document Index 1:  Tweet with a location\\nYou can add location information to your Tweets, such as your city or precise location, from the web and via third-party applications.

Dick Durbin, D-Ill., sought a promise from Kavanaugh that he would be willing to serve as a check on the president who nominated him.\\n\"Give us some reassurance about your commitment to the democratic institutions in this country, in the face of a president who seems prepared to cast them aside,\" Durbin said. \"Whether it\\'s voter suppression, the role of the media - case after case, we hear this president willing to walk away from the rule of law in this country.\"\\n\"No one is above the law,\" Kavanaugh replied. \"I\\'ve made clear in my writings that a court order that requires a president to do something or prohibits a president from doing something under the Constitution or laws of the United States is the final word in our system.\"\\nSen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, complained that the Supreme Court had been unduly deferential to President Trump this summer when it upheld his travel ban, despite what she called the administration\\'s \"obviously bogus\" justification. She pressed Kavanaugh on when the high court should question a president\\'s national security claims.\\n\"National security is not a blank check for the president,\" Kavanaugh said, pointing to a number of cases in which the court had overruled the administration. \"Even in the context of wartime, the courts are not silenced. Civil liberties are not silent.\"\\nKavanaugh told lawmakers he is so committed to judicial independence, he stopped voting in national elections after he became a judge.\\nSen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., again asked Kavanaugh if he\\'d ever spoken with anyone at the law firm of Trump\\'s personal attorney Marc Kasowitz about special counsel Robert Mueller\\'s investigation, renewing a line of questioning she\\'d opened Wednesday night.\\n\"The answer is no,\" Kavanaugh said.\\nAs he\\'s done throughout the hearing, Kavanaugh declined to answer a series of questions from Harris about issues that might come before the high court, including abortion, same-sex marriage and immigration.\\nThe White House issued a statement late Thursday praising Kavanaugh.\\n\"Through long hours and days of questioning, Judge Kavanaugh consistently reinforced his firm belief in the bedrock principles of judicial independence and the rule of law,\" deputy press secretary Raj Shah said in the statement.\\nKavanaugh was asked repeatedly during the televised hearing about whether he would support opening the Supreme Court to TV cameras. He promised to keep an open mind, but said he would also want to consider the views of the eight current justices.\\nThursday\\'s session began with Democrats on the committee in open revolt over the handling of documents from Kavanaugh\\'s tenure in the George W. Bush White House.\\nSome documents have been withheld altogether. Others have been provided to the committee on \"confidential\" terms, meaning senators can see them but they can\\'t be made public.\\nDemocrats object that the confidential label has been applied to a wide swath of records, many of which contain no personal or sensitive information. They also complain that classification decisions were made by former President Bush\\'s attorney, William Burck, a former deputy of Kavanaugh\\'s.\\nSen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., released some of the confidential documents Thursday morning. Hirono also released \"confidential\" documents, drawing a stern rebuke from Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, who called them \"irresponsible and outrageous.\"\\n\"This is no different from the senator deciding to release classified information,\" Cornyn said Thursday morning. \"No senator deserves to sit on this committee, or serve in the Senate, in my view, if they decide to be a law unto themselves and willingly flout the rules of the Senate and the determination of confidentiality and classification.\"\\nRead the documents released by Sen. Hirono here and the documents released by Sen. Leahy here.\\nFor all the theatrics on both sides, the debate over documents fizzled by Thursday afternoon, once it became clear their release had been authorized by Bush\\'s attorney overnight.\\n\"We cleared the documents last night shortly after Senator Booker\\'s staff asked us to,\" Burck said in a statement. \"In fact, we have said yes to every request made by the Senate Democrats to make documents public.\"\\nAnd an aide to Grassley told NPR that \"counsels for the senators who requested waivers last night/this morning for particular documents were notified that their requests had been honored beginning at around 3:50 this morning.\"\\nBut a spokesperson for Hirono said the senator was not informed that the documents released by her office Thursday morning had been approved to be made public.\\nIt is not clear whether Booker knew the documents he released had already been approved before his statements Thursday morning at the beginning of the hearing - when he said that his decision to release the documents was a form of civil disobedience and that he was aware he was risking expulsion from the Senate for making the documents public.\\n\"Cory said this morning that he was releasing committee confidential documents, and that\\'s exactly what he\\'s done,\" Booker spokeswoman Kristin Lynch said in an email to NPR. \"Last night, he was admonished by Republicans for breaking the rules when he read from committee confidential documents. Cory and Senate Democrats were able to shame the committee into agreeing to make last night\\'s documents publicly available, and Cory publicly released those documents as well as other committee confidential documents today. And he\\'ll keep releasing them because Republicans are hiding Brett Kavanaugh\\'s record from the American people.\"\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Jacquelyn Martin/AP Jacquelyn Martin/AP\\nThe documents released by Booker include a batch of emails concerning racial profiling, affirmative action and other race-conscious government programs.\\nIn a 2002 email, Kavanaugh wrote that security procedures adopted in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks should ultimately be race-neutral, though he acknowledged that developing such procedures could take time. Others in the White House suggested racial profiling might be legally justified if it enhanced security.\\nIn a 2001 email, Kavanaugh addressed a legal challenge to an affirmative action program within the Department of Transportation.\\n\"The fundamental problem in this case is that these DOT regulations use a lot of legalisms and disguises to mask what in reality is a naked racial set-aside,\" he wrote.\\nKavanaugh had sidestepped questions from Booker on Wednesday night about the circumstances in which government can and cannot use race-conscious measures to address past discrimination.\\nHe conceded that hopes he expressed nearly two decades ago for a color-blind society have not been fulfilled.\\n\"We see on an all-too-common basis that racism still exists in the United States of America,\" Kavanaugh said. \"Our long march to racial equality is not over.\"\\nSeparately, The New York Times reported on leaked emails from the \"confidential\" file. One is an email drafted by Kavanaugh in 2003, in which he questioned whether the Supreme Court\\'s 1973 Roe v. Wade decision legalizing abortion should be described as \"settled law of the land.\"\\nPressed on that email by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., on Thursday, Kavanaugh explained he was simply summarizing views of legal scholars and not offering his own view.\\nOn Wednesday, Kavanaugh said he understands the weight that many people attach to Roe. But he declined to say whether that case was properly decided.\\nThroughout the hearing, Kavanaugh has avoided commenting on Trump\\'s behavior, despite urging from Senate Democrats.\\n\"I\\'m not going to get within three zip codes of a political controversy,\" he said Thursday, when Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., asked him about Trump\\'s attacks on judges, including Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.\\n\"I\\'ve spoken about my respect and appreciation for the eight justices on the Supreme Court,\" Kavanaugh said. \"I know they\\'re all dedicated public servants who have given a great deal to this country.\"\\nBarring surprises, Kavanaugh appears likely to win confirmation in time to take his place alongside those eight justices when the Supreme Court begins its fall term next month.\\nNot seeing the video?

Doc used to take showers with the team even though he didn\\'t do any workouts, and everybody used to snicker about how you go into his office for a sore shoulder and he tells you to take your pants down.\"\\nWhen the first stories about the university investigation appeared this spring, Jordan told The Columbus Dispatch, \"I had not heard about any type of abuse at all.\" He also said that \"no one reported any type of abuse\" to him.\\nAfter NBC News reached out to Jordan, the congressman\\'s spokesman repeated the denial.\\n\"Congressman Jordan never saw any abuse, never heard about any abuse, and never had any abuse reported to him during his time as a coach at Ohio State,\" his spokesman, Ian Fury, said in an email to NBC News.\\nShortly after the NBC News story was published, Fury added the following statement: \"He has not been contacted by investigators about the matter but will assist them in any way they ask, because if what is alleged is true, the victims deserve a full investigation and justice.\"\\nBut Kathleen Trafford of Porter Wright Morris & Arthur, the Dayton, Ohio-based law firm that was appointed as legal counsel to Ohio State, said in a statement that investigators \"had previously contacted Rep. Jordan\\'s office by email and phone to request that he participate in an interview.\"\\n\"To date, Rep. Jordan has not responded to those requests,\" Trafford wrote. \"The investigative team is continuing its efforts to schedule an interview with Rep. Jordan.\"\\nJordan, a founder of the House Freedom Caucus, a group of the most conservative representatives, is a staunch ally of President Donald Trump and is frequently mentioned as a possible replacement for the speaker of the House, Paul Ryan.\\nRyan, through his spokesman Doug Andres, also weighed in on the Ohio State investigation and Jordan\\'s role.\\n\"These are serious allegations and issues,\" Andres said. \"The university has rightfully initiated a full investigation into the matter. The speaker will await the findings of that inquiry.\"\\nDiSabato forwarded to NBC News an email he sent on April 24 to Jordan and the congressman\\'s brother, Jeff, who runs Jeff Jordan\\'s State Champ Camp, a nationally known wrestling camp in Ohio. DiSabato sent the email 19 days after Ohio State announced on April 5 that it was investigating Strauss and the administrators of the wrestling program at the time, including the coaches, just as other colleges have done in similar circumstances.\\nDiSabato was concerned that the university would ultimately sweep his allegations under the rug, and he wanted to ensure that Jordan would back him up.\\n\"I ask you to give your full attention to the information attached to this email,\" DiSabato wrote. \"We [are] watching you. ... You have the platform to cut through the double talk, placation and finger pointing.\"\\nJordan and his brother did not reply to the email, DiSabato said. Jeff Jordan said in an email that he\\'d never attended or worked at Ohio State University.\\nRep. Jim Jordan speaks during a hearing before the House Judiciary Committee on Capitol Hill on June 28. Alex Wong / Getty Images\\nJim Jordan, who has made a name for himself in Congress by grilling investigators probing alleged collusion by the Trump campaign with the Russians, is among the witnesses expected to be questioned by the law firm that Ohio State hired to conduct the probe into Strauss\\' misconduct, officials involved with the investigation said.\\nIn the video that DiSabato made about the allegations against Strauss, which DiSabato sent to Ohio State in June, Hellickson, the former head wrestling coach, said he told school administrators about Strauss and also warned the doctor to steer clear of his wrestlers.\\n\"I said, \\'You make the guys nervous when you shower with them,\\'\" Hellickson said in the video. \"His response was, \\'Coach, you shower with your guys all the time.\\' And I said, \\'Not for an hour, Doc.\\'\"\\nDiSabato and his former teammates said Jordan and Hellickson were close, and if the head coach had qualms about Strauss he would have shared them with his No. 2.\\n\"Jim was Coach Russ\\' right-hand man,\" one former wrestler said.\\nHellickson, an Olympics silver medalist in wrestling in 1976 who has done commentary from the games for NBC Sports, did not return calls for comment.\\nIn response to a series of questions from NBC, Ohio State emailed a statement saying that the law firm Perkins Coie was overseeing the probe into the Strauss allegations for the university. OSU said it has also reached out \"to the Columbus Division of Police and the Franklin County Prosecuting Attorney\\'s Office for any potential criminal investigation.\"\\n\"To date, Perkins Coie has interviewed more than 150 former students and witnesses and is engaged in further investigative efforts,\" the university said in the statement. \"Ohio State has shared all additional information that has come to the attention of the university with the independent investigators whose work is ongoing.\"\\nIt\\'s unclear whether former Ohio State coaches or administrators could face any penalties from the university for not protecting wrestlers from Strauss.\\n\"Our efforts will continue to be focused on uncovering what may have happened during this era, what university leaders at the time may have known, and whether any response at the time was appropriate,\" the university\\'s statement said. \"Once the independent investigation has been completed, we will be in a position to consider what further action might be appropriate.\"\\nJordan is wrestling royalty. Born and raised in Champaign County, Ohio, he was a four-time state wrestling champion. Competing for the University of Wisconsin-Madison, he won NCAA titles in 1985 and 1986.\\nBut in the wrestling world, Jordan is best known for defeating future two-time Olympic gold medalist John Smith twice in an NCAA tournament in 1985.\\nJordan returned home to Ohio and - while working as a coach - earned a master\\'s degree in education at Ohio State and later a law degree from Capital University in Columbus before launching his political career in 1994 when he was elected to the Ohio General Assembly.\\nA 1978 employment application information for Dr. Richard Strauss, from Ohio State University personnel files. Ohio State University via AP file\\nStrauss signed on at Ohio State as an attending physician in September 1978 and served as a team physician in the athletics department from July 1981 to June 1995, according to the university\\'s statement. He also worked as a part-time doctor in the university\\'s student health department from July 1994 to August 1996.\\nAfter resigning from the Ohio State medical staff in 1994, Strauss stayed on as an emeritus faculty member until he retired in July 1998 and moved from Columbus to Los Angeles, the university said.\\nCiting Los Angeles County coroner records, The Columbus Dispatch reported that Strauss died of suicide in 2005 after struggling with pain and other health issues.\\nStrauss\\' relatives have not spoken publicly about the allegations since they surfaced. NBC News was not able to reach any of his relatives.\\nDiSabato, who runs a Columbus-based sports and entertainment agency called the Profectus Group, said the recent conviction of former Olympics gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar prompted him and other Ohio State athletes to come forward about Strauss.\\nStrauss\\' primary job was to give wrestlers physicals, treat them for injuries and monitor their health, DiSabato said. He said Strauss also preyed on students who played other sports.\\n\"Strauss sexually assaulted male athletes in at least fifteen varsity sports during his employment at OSU from 1978 through 1998,\" DiSabato wrote in a June 26 email to Kathleen M. Trafford of Porter Wright Morris & Arthur, the Columbus-based law firm that represents Ohio State. \"Athlete victims include members of the following programs: football, basketball, wrestling, swimming, cheerleading, volleyball, lacrosse, gymnastics, ice hockey, soccer, baseball, tennis, track and cross country.\"\\nChillingly, DiSabato added: \"Based on testimony from victim athletes from each of the aforementioned varsity sports, we estimate that Strauss sexually assaulted and/or raped a minimum of 1,500/2,000 athletes at OSU from 1978 through 1998.\"\\nOhio State has confirmed that investigators have received \"confidential reports of sexual misconduct committed by Strauss\" from former athletes in 14 sports and from former patients in Student Health Services.\\nIn the video, DiSabato said Strauss knew that many of the athletes were small-town kids who weren\\'t likely to protest if the doctor told them to disrobe, for fear of losing their scholarships. He said coaches knew that Strauss was a predator.\\n\"Everybody knew before you were going into the [examination] room that Doc Strauss was going to touch you,\" DiSabato said. \"It was like a joke before you went in there.\"\\nStrauss wasn\\'t the only Ohio State official who showered with the team, DiSabato said. After practice ended at 3:30 p.m., some university professors, administrators and others would show up in the shower stalls just as the athletes were arriving, he said.\\nIt was, DiSabato said, like walking through \"the gauntlet of sexual deviancy.\"\\nAnother former wrestler whose testimony appears on the video DiSabato submitted to investigators described how Strauss grabbed his penis during an examination.\\n\"I didn\\'t do a thing,\" he said when asked how he responded. \"Probably, because I was scared.\"\\nHe broke down when asked why, after all these years, he was speaking out.\\n\"Why am I doing this now? It\\'s just hard,\" he said. \"I don\\'t want this to ever have to happen to anybody else, ever ... at The Ohio State University or any school.\"'], 'saliences': ['(2, 164-376)', '(2, 595-601;674-722;777-801)', '(2, 3627-3746)', '(2, 3198-3422)', '(2, 2406-2623)', '(2, 3473-3543)', '(0, 158-327)', '(0, 350-362;364-489)', '(0, 777-795;828-962)', '(0, 490-575)', '(0, 680-706;731-764)', '(0, 1267-1324;1326-1340)', '(0, 1526-1738)', '(0, 1739-1833;1848-1861;1878-1886;1912-1919)', '(0, 1921-1976)', '(0, 2048-2115)', '(0, 2196-2230)', '(0, 2248-2260;2290-2352;2409-2529)', '(0, 2117-2150)', '(0, 2691-2697;2822-2841)', '(0, 2873-2901)', '(0, 4902-4994)', '(0, 4608-4714)', '(0, 4927-4994)', '(0, 3303-3313;3365-3453)', '(0, 3272-3348)', '(0, 3215-3244;3454-3503)', '(1, 17-33;85-196;219-230)', '(1, 303-487)']}) (input_keys={'documents'}) with <function metric at 0x7f199866d790> due to CUDA out of memory.

Simpson that for a little while filled TV screens across America on Thursday.\\nA Nevada parole board decided Simpson should be freed after the former NFL star apologized for his role in a 2007 armed robbery, said he\\'d been a model prisoner, and promised that he\\'d have no conflicts if released.\\nSimpson\\'s appearance before the board garnered wall-to-wall coverage from cable news shows, coverage that recalled the \"trial of the century,\" and the many months more than 20 years ago when it transfixed a nation.\\n\"I\\'ve done my time,\" Simpson said. \"I\\'ve done it as well and as respectfully as I think anyone can.\"\\nNow 70, Simpson\\'s energy seemed little affected by his time behind bars. He was alert, engaged, and quick to smile, even letting out a hearty laugh when parole board Chairman Connie Bisbee accidentally said he was aged 90. \"I feel like it,\" he said.\\nSimpson has served nine years of a nine-to-33-year sentence for an armed robbery and kidnapping in Las Vegas. He is expected to be released as early as October -- and said he plans to move to his home in Florida.\\nAn entire generation of Americans has come of age since Simpson seemed an almost inescapable public figure. But for one afternoon, it felt like 1995 again.\\nThat was the year he was acquitted of murder charges in the grisly slayings of his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman.\\nThursday\\'s parole hearing followed renewed interest in his story, which was explored last year in the award-winning documentary \"O.J.: Made in America\" and the FX true-crime drama \"The People v. O.J. Simpson.\"\\nThough it\\'s been 22 years since the not guilty verdict, the murder trial\\'s themes of criminal justice and race, trust in police, celebrity and domestic violence remain remarkably resonant in modern culture. \"We talk about O.J. as though the story is O.J.,\" journalist Celia Farber says toward the end of the \"Made in America\" documentary. \"The story is O.J. and us.\"\\nParole board vote unanimous\\nFor his part, Simpson seemed remarkably unaltered. He repeatedly avoided taking full responsibility for the Vegas crime.\\nAt one point, he said he had lived a \"conflict-free life,\" a statement that perhaps bemused anyone whose memory stretches back more than two decades.\\n\"Juice,\" as he was known in his heyday, said associates misled him during the Vegas robbery and then turned on him in court.\\nOne of those associates is Tom Riccio. Simpson testified that Riccio is the one who called him, persuading him to take part in the robbery. Simpson said Thursday he regretted ever taking Riccio\\'s call.\\nBut, according to Riccio, Simpson did a lot more than that.\\n\"He should wish he didn\\'t make all those calls after my call,\" Riccio told CNN. \"After he took my call he did a lot of things he shouldn\\'t have done.\"\\nRiccio added that Simpson was the one who orchestrated the robbery.\\n\"He plotted it all and gathered up men with guns.\"\\nSimpson said Riccio avoided punishment by throwing him under the bus.\\n\"Unfortunately, they got a get-out-of-jail-free card when they said \\'O.J. told me (to do it),\\'\" Simpson said. \"Nothing I can do about that.\"\\nSufficient remorse is not a relevant factor for parole, and Simpson ticked off several mitigating factors that made him a good candidate for release. He was discipline-free in prison, he has stable release plans, he has family and community support -- and, of course, he has no prior criminal convictions.\\nThe four parole board members voted unanimously to grant him parole, and board member Tony Corda said he was graded a \"low risk to reoffend.\"\\nSimpson smiled, said \"thank you,\" and then put his head down for a few moments silently.\\nO.J.

I am sorry that things turned out the way they did. I had no intent to commit a crime.\"\\nThe parole hearing featured testimony from Arnelle Simpson, the former football great\\'s oldest daughter, who said her father was \"my best friend and my rock.\"\\nSimpson also said he has taken two \"Alternative to Violence\" classes, which he said was \"the most important course any person in this prison can take.\"\\nIn addition, robbery victim Bruce Fromong testified that he had forgiven Simpson for the crime at that Las Vegas hotel room, and advocated for his release.\\nSimpson had also been described by authorities as a model prisoner at Lovelock Correctional Center, a medium-security prison in the Nevada desert.\\nThe robbery\\nSimpson and an associate were convicted of kidnapping, armed robbery and assault with a deadly weapon for attempting to steal pieces of Simpson sports memorabilia at gunpoint.\\nAt his 2008 sentencing, the Hall of Fame running back said he went to the room in the Palace Station Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas to reclaim family heirlooms and other personal items that had been taken from him. He also claimed he didn\\'t know his associates were armed.\\n\"I wasn\\'t there to hurt anybody,\" Simpson said. \"I just wanted my personal things, and I realize now that was stupid of me.

On Thursday, her attorney said she would plead not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect in the Slender Man case. She and Morgan Geyser are accused of stabbing another girl. (Photo: Michael Sears / Milwaukee Journal Sentinel)\\\\nAnissa Weier plans to enter a plea of not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect in the Slender Man stabbing case next week.\\\\nWeier\\'s co-defendant, Morgan Geyser, had already entered such a plea, often referred to as NGI, at a hearing last month.\\\\nAt the time, prosecutors pressed the judge to inquire whether Weier might go the same route, since it requires the court to appoint doctors to examine the defendant and report whether their condition would support the plea. One of Weier\\'s attorneys, Maura McMahon, said the defense had not yet decided.\\\\nBut in a pleading filed this week, McMahon indicated that Weier now wants to change her not guilty plea to the insanity plea. A hearing was set for Sept. 9 for that change of plea.\\\\nWeier and Geyser, both 14, were 12 when prosecutors say they plotted and attempted to kill their sixth-grade classmate and friend Payton Leutner in May 2014.\\\\nARCHIVE: Slender Man case coverage\\\\nLeutner was stabbed 19 times and left for dead in a Waukesha park the morning after a sleepover party for Geyser\\'s 12th birthday, but managed to crawl near a path, where she was found by a passing bicyclist.\\\\nBoth defendants later told police they were trying to either impress or avoid the wrath of Slender Man, a fictional internet boogeyman the girls said they believed would harm them or their families if they didn\\'t kill their friend.\\\\nThey remain charged as adults with attempted first-degree intentional homicide, after efforts to have their cases transferred to juvenile court were denied.\\\\nA defendant entering an NGI plea contends that at the time she committed a crime, a mental disease or defect prevented her from appreciating the wrongfulness of her action, or from conforming her conduct to the law.\\\\nSomeone found not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect is typically committed to a state mental hospital for treatment.\\\\nGeyser, who has been diagnosed with early onset schizophrenia, has already spent months at Winnebago Mental Health Institute under a separate civil commitment.\\\\nDuring earlier hearings, mental health experts testified that Weier was competent to proceed with the case, but had not done more extensive evaluations required for an NGI review. She remains at a West Bend juvenile detention center.\\\\nNo trial date has been set in the case.\\\\nRead or Share this story: http://on.jsonl.in/2civi3X \", \" Two girls accused of trying to kill a classmate to please horror character Slender Man want jurors from outside their home county to decide their trials.\\\\n\\\\nMorgan Geyser\\'s attorneys filed a motion this week seeking jurors from outside Waukesha County because of heavy media coverage. Geyser has pleaded not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect.\\\\n\\\\nA letter the other girl\\'s defense attorneys submitted to the court seeks outside jurors as well. The letter noted that girl plans to plead not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect.\\\\n\\\\nInvestigators say Geyser and Anissa Weier, who were 12 at the time of the 2014 attack, plotted for months before luring the victim, who also was 12, into some woods and repeatedly stabbing her. The girls hoped killing her would please Slender Man, a demon-like character in online stories.\\\\n\\\\nThe victim crawled out of the woods to get help.\\\\nBoth girls face an attempted homicide charge in adult court. Their attorneys had been fighting to move them into juvenile court but a state appeals court in July ruled they should remain in adult court.\\\\n\\\\n\"]\\nSalience: [\\'A\\', \\'n\\', \\'i\\',\\'s\\',\\'s\\', \\'a\\',\\'\\', \\'W\\', \\'e\\', \\'i\\', \\'e\\', \\'r\\',\\'\\', \\'i\\',\\'s\\',\\'\\', \\'b\\', \\'r\\', \\'o\\', \\'u\\', \\'g\\', \\'h\\', \\'t\\',\\'\\', \\'i\\', \\'n\\', \\'t\\', \\'o\\',\\'\\', \\'c\\', \\'o\\', \\'u\\', \\'r\\', \\'t\\',\\'\\', \\'f\\', \\'o\\', \\'r\\',\\'\\', \\'a\\',\\'\\', \\'h\\', \\'e\\', \\'a\\', \\'r\\', \\'i\\', \\'n\\', \\'g\\',\\'\\', \\'l\\', \\'a\\',\\'s\\', \\'t\\','\n",
